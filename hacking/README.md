setting up
---

* Start with an empty cluster (e.g. docker-desktop)
* Run `setup.sh` which installs crossplane and all providers needed for examples
* The setup script displays environment variables that control versions etc. You can override these variables in 
  a `.userenv` script in this directory or by setting them in your environment.
